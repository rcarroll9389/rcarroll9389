 Hey there, I’m Ryan Carroll
 I’m currently a Data Analyst at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
 in the Office of HIV/AIDS. 
 I have extensive experience analyzing health and economic data in support of international development programs, 
 alongside supporting ongoing USAID and US Government COVID-19 initiatives and interventions in USAID supported 
 countries
 I have advanced analytical skills, and am advanced in R, SQL, Tableau, and Microsoft Office. I also have experience working in 
 Python and Alteryx. 
 I am also learning advanced Database engineering skills through Meta's Database Engineering course on Coursera. 
 I am interested in gaining experience in Data Engineering and am interested in roles with a mix of data analysis and engineering.
