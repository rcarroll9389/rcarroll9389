Hey there, I’m Ryan Carroll and currently I work as the lead Data Scientist for USAID’s Office of Policy Implementation and Analytics. I support clients and stakeholders by providing advanced analytical products, presentations and reports to support government funding and policy decisions. I own multiple data streams, Tableau dashboards and analytical products from start to finish. In my career with USAID I have worked extensively with patient level, economic, financial, programmatic, and global health data. I complete a wide array of tasks, including but not limited to, R and Python programing, database management, Tableau dashboard development, analytical briefings, and policy resource development. Using statistical software such as R, Python, SQL, GIS, and Tableau, I clean and manipulate many public and international datasets that populate these dashboards and reports. I produce and own custom reports and dashboards based on client requirements to aid in policy decision making for US government initiatives. I have been at USAID since May of 2020, and have held multiple data analyst roles through different government contracts while at the agency.
